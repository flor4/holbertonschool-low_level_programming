What are files in C?

A file is used to store huge data. C provides multiple file management functions
like file creation, OPENING and READING files, WRITING to the file, and CLOSING a file.
The file is used to store relevant data and file handling in C is used to manipulate the data.

Types of Files in C:

There are mainly two types of files that can be handled using File Handling in C as mentioned below:

- Text Files.
- Binary Files.

1. Text Files

These are simple text files that are saved by the (.txt) extension and can be created or modified by any text editor.
Text file stores data in the form of ASCII characters and is used to store a stream of characters.

2. Binary Files

It is stored in binary format instead of ASCII characters.
Binary files are normally used to store numeric Information (int, float, double).
Here data is stored in binary form i.e, (0's and 1's).
